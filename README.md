This project involves machine learning techniques that was used in the final project for the University of Minnesota Data Analytics Boot Camp. This project was designed to showcase our skills with machine learning and using that to work with the data.

The group is made up of Beryl Kaczmarczik, Farshad Esnaashari, Katherine Rootes, and Matt Pollari.

We ended up taking the Heart Disease data set from the University of California, Irvine machine learning repository. We chose this data set because it had categorical data that we could use to test on and it also had been cleaned up so that it had a much lower bar to entry to actually start doing machine learning projects on the data set.

The Heart Disease data set had trimmed down the attributes from the 76 initially there to a smaller subset of 14 attributes. The 14 attributes largely set the stage for us to start just working with it and not do much processing work.

We used the data to look at different models and methods for predicting heart disease using the five machine learning models:  Neural Networks, K Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest. Click on the different models above to see how each of them performed and our analysis.
