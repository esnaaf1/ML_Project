                 <h1><strong>K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Machine Learning Algorithm</strong></h1>
                 <p> 
                  <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
                  <p>A k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) algorithm, is an approach to data classification that estimates how likely a data point is to be a member of one group or the other depending on what group the data points nearest to it are in.</p>
                  <p>KNN is an example of a "lazy learner" algorithm, meaning that it does not build a model using the training set until a query of the data set is performed.</p>
                  <p>The elegance of KNN algorithm lies in its simplicity. Despite its various drawbackâ€™s such as high compute time in high dimension data it is still widely used in areas of bio-informatics and computer vision tasks.</p>
                  <p>KNN robust with regards to the search space; for instance, the classes do not have to be linearly separable. &nbsp;There are only two parameters to tune: k and distance metric.</p>
                  <p><strong>Implementation on the Heart Disease dataset&nbsp;</strong></p>
                  <p>We used KNN as a classifier algorithm.&nbsp;&nbsp;After splitting the heart disease data into train and test sets, the data was scaled and encoded. A KNN classifier model was setup, we looped through a list of K values to determine the best accuracy score.</p>
                  <p>The results showed that the K=5 results in the best score for both train and test data.</p>
                   <center><img src="resources/k5which.jpg" alt="K nearest results"></center>       
         </p>
         <p>The overall accuracy of the model was 0.784.</p>
         <p><u>Algorithm modification and tuning:&nbsp;</u>&nbsp; Given the limited data samples, K-Fold Cross-Validation was used to resample and evaluate the KNN model. &nbsp;</p>
         <p>In k-fold cross-validation, the original sample is randomly partitioned into k equal size sub samples. Of the k sub samples, a single sub sample is retained as the validation data for testing the model, and the remaining k-1 sub samples are used as training data. The cross-validation process is then repeated k times (the folds), with each of the k sub samples used exactly once as the validation data. The k results from the folds can then be averaged (or otherwise combined) to produce a single estimation. The advantage of this method is that all observations are used for both training and validation, and each observation is used for validation exactly once.</p>
         <p>In addition, GridSearchCV along with cross-validation was used to evaluate the model across various parameters. &nbsp;</p>
         <p>The graph below shows mean accuracy across the different k values after the k-fold cross-validation and GridSearchCV was used.</p>
